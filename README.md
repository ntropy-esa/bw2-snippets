# bw2-snippets
A compilation of code snippets, useful when using brightway2, the python framework for life cycle assessment, especially when starting

The code snippets are compiled in a jupyter notebook, and described with markdown text and/or in-line comments. 

Future to-do:
- split in several notebooks, per theme / user level
- create a jupyter notebook "extension" to access the code snippets directly in jupyter's gui
